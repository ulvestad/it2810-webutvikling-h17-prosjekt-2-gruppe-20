      <h1>Some other coffee drinks</h1>
      <div>
        <h3>Americano</h3>
        Make a shot of espresso coffee and pour it into a 6-ounce cup. Add boiling water into the cup until the coffee reaches the top. Have steamed milk on the side to add, along with a sugar cube.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Caf√© au lait</h3>
        Steamed milk and hot coffee blend to make the perfect mellow beverage, a cafe au lait. Serve the comforting drink at a traditional French breakfast or as an after brunch coffee with a single square of dark chocolate.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Cappuccino</h3>
        Top the espresso with foamed milk right after foaming. When initially poured, cappuccinos are only espresso and foam, but the liquid milk quickly settles out of the foam to create the (roughly) equal parts foam, steamed milk and espresso for which cappuccino
        is known. Serve immediately.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Cortado</h3>
        Make a shot of Espresso coffee and let it brew into a coffee cup twice the size of your normal one. Fill half of it. Steam the milk, but make sure you do not create a dry foam; foam bubbles must be tiny and kept inside the milk creating velvety light
        texture. Add the milk into the shot of Espresso and serve.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Latte</h3>
        Heat milk in a saucepan set over medium-low heat. Whisk briskly with a wire whisk to create foam. Brew espresso and pour into 4 cups. Pour in milk, holding back the foam with a spoon. Spoon foam over the top.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Macchiato</h3>
        In a macchiato cup (about four ounces), top the espresso with a dollop of steamed milk. Serve immediately.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Irish coffee</h3>
        Fill footed mug or a mug with hot water to preheat it, then empty. Pour piping hot coffee into warmed glass until it is about 3/4 full. Add the brown sugar and stir until completely dissolved. Blend in Irish whiskey. Top with a collar of the whipped heavy
        cream by pouring gently over back of spoon. Serve hot.
