          Seventy percent of coffee beans are Arabica. Although less popular, Robusta is slightly more bitter and has twice as much caffeine.

          Coffee beans as we know them are actually the pits of a cherry-like berry that are grown on bushes, thus they are a <span id="span3"> fruit.</span>

          Legend has it that 9th century goat herders noticed the effect caffeine had on their goats, who appeared to "dance" after eating coffee berries.
          <br></br> 
          A local monk then made a drink with coffee berries and found that it kept him awake at night, thus the <span id="span3"> original cup of coffee</span> was born.
